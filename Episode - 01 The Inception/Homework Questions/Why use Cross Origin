Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

Very Good Resource on CORS

A cross-origin request is a request for website resources external to the origin. For example, a.example.com attempts to serve resources from b.secondexample.com.
CORS instructs the browser to determine if a cross-origin request, such as an image or JavaScript from b.secondexample.com, is allowed by a.example.com. The browser does not load resources that are disallowed by CORS.
Since we want to load the React code from an external resource other than origin, we need to enable CORS when using CDN.
In case of Importing React using CDN, do include the cross-origin attribute.

You can tweak the HTTP header on your origin server. All it takes is an additional HTTP header called Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
